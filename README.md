# ReadCounts
RNA-Seq is a sequencing technique that has been utilized in quantifying cellular transcriptome and 
enable a better understanding of various biological processess.

One key step in RNASeq data analysis involves generation of count data following mapping of 
next-generation sequence data to host reference genomes. With limited access to high-performance computing
environments and due to large sizes of reads and host files involved, this process has become challenging.

Working with [LathcBio](https://latch.bio/), I have automated the read-count step within the RNASeq workflow.

[ReadCount](https://github.com/mikemwanga/ReadCounts) tool takes in host reference genome and its associated annotation file plus filtered raw reads and outputs 
count data that can be taken forward for analysis.
